This guide provides assistance making web sites and applications friendly for
people with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. The patterns in this
guide provide practical guidance to improve the accessibility of designs and
the design process.

The objectives and patterns presented here provide
<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement">
supplemental guidance</a>
beyond the requirements of The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG
[[WCAG22]]. They are intended to address barriers that could not be included
in the normative WCAG [[WCAG22]] specification and may not otherwise be
addressed.

This guide is divided into design objectives. An outline of these objectives
can also be found in the Summary section. Simply understanding the objectives
and related user stories may help designers make content more accessible to
some users with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>.

Each objective contains a number of practical patterns (repeated designs for
controls and other elements) that describe what to do to address user needs.
Implementing these patterns is <strong>essential</strong> for some people with
<a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> to be able to use content
independently.
